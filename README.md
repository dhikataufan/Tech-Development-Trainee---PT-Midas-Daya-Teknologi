This repository contains my solution for the Stack Data Structure Implementation and Valid Parentheses Problem, as part of the technical assignment. The implementation is written in Java and adheres to the required O(1) time complexity for stack operations.

Features & Implementations
1. Stack Implementation
A custom Stack class with the following operations:

✔️ new Stack() – Creates an empty stack.
✔️ push(item) – Adds an item to the stack (O(1)).
✔️ pop() – Removes and returns the top item (O(1)).
✔️ isEmpty() – Checks if the stack is empty (O(1)).
✔️ peek() – Returns the top item without removing it (O(1)).
✔️ length() – Returns the number of elements (O(1)).

2. Valid Parentheses Checker
A function that verifies whether a given string of brackets '()[]{}' is valid based on:

✔️ Correct closing order
✔️ Matching bracket pairs

Usage & Testing
The code includes test cases to validate the functionality of both the Stack class and the Valid Parentheses Checker.
